			<h3>A bit of background</h3>

			<p>Every four years during the Olympics, we all love watching the swimming events. But how much does everyone really know about swimming as a sport? This page is here to tell you more about swimming and what makes it the greatest sport of all time.</p>

			<p>Competitive swimming is made up of four different strokes, and competitions usually take place in either a 25 yd or 50 meter pool. 50 meter pools are considered Olympic sized. Most pools are 6 or 8 lanes, and all strokes with the exception of backstroke start with a dive start from a starting block.</p>

			<h3>Another Source About Swimming</h3>

			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.olympic.org/swimming-equipment-and-history">Olympic Swimming Site</a>

			<p>I thought this website was nice for a couple of reasons. It has a pretty simple design, both in the layout and the styling. The code is pretty minimal, although it does use some jQuery and javascript for a few elements. I also thought they designed the page pretty intuitively for users, so it is easy to navigate and find what you're looking for. I did notice that some of their images are broken, and I'm curious whether that is from the server hosting the images being down or if they are linked to incorrectly. I also noticed that they used section tags with div tags within that, which I'm guessing has to do with they styling of the page.</p>
